        <h3>
            The website represents the artist‚Äôs photographs: minimal, clean, and diverse. Various autoscrolling images in close
            proximities, gives a solid overview of the Alex‚Äôs body of work on first impression ‚Äì the aim of this portfolio. Generous
            use of white space balances each photo groupings while also allows the user to focus on the detail, color, and
            composition of each individual image.
        </h3>
        <h4>
            The challenge was to create a unity between diverse photographs and put them side by side in the same view, in order to
            provide harmonious overview of Alex Ensoe‚Äôs works. Each photo has different lighting, focusing on different kinds of
            objects, and had their own context. Furthermore, each photograph has a unique ratio so they could not be displayed
            neatly in a grid.

                    <p>Worked in collaboration with Alex, the artist, to group and sort similar types of pictures in order to create the most impactful subsets. Alex did not
                    want to tag the images, give names to them, or put them into a collection ‚Äì he simply wanted an overview of all his
                    photographs. The images are mostly grouped by colors, shapes, and patterns that are similar or complementary to each
                    other. They are all curated to grab the users' attention and guide the eye to go through the series of photographs. </p>

                    <p>After grouping the similar photographs together, I explored different ways to structure and organise those images in
                        order to showoff the various types of images while also giving each photo the attention they deserve. The solution
                        was
                        to let the audience discover Alex‚Äôs work by scrolling through groups of photographs that appear randomly generated.
                        Since the images do not have same ratio, they would look awkward being displayed in a well-structured manner. Thus,
                        perceived randomness is the best solution. The images overlay on top of each other and sometimes side by side, they
                        have
                        uneven distribution within and between the groups, and finally each groups do not start at different columns.
                        Despite
                        the ‚Äúchaos‚Äù, each image adheres to the grid.</p>
                        <p class="lowertext-p">The 48-column grid with 20px rows provides structure to the curation yet allows flexibility to simulate randomness. The
                        spacings are small enough to place the images within the layout yet big enough to provide necessary white-space between
                        images. As each image have different ratios, the images will align to the starting of the grid, from left to right, and
                        each will have their individual end point (that may or may not align perfectly with the grid).</p>
                        <p class="lowertext-p">The ‚Äúchaos‚Äù intrigues the audience by bringing out wide-ranging photographic subjects. It also creates unpredictability
                        and thus adds dynamictism to the series of minimal photography. Yet, the pre-curated groups of images aligning to the
                        grid provides structure and visual guidance to the user, resulting in harmonious looking photographic series.</p>
