            <p>This page is dedicated to my ongoing research projects to explore and question our beings within the bounds of the
                capitalistic society. I draw on public policy, political theory, psychology, and interaction design to produce
                contemplative artworks that prompt personal and societal reflections.</p>

        <h3>
            Interactive featured article under Discontent, an electronic music publication. The long-format translates an
            interview
            of Lapaluxâ€™s album â€˜Amnioverseâ€™ into an immersive digitalised experience. The user is guided through Lapaluxâ€™s
            inspirations, process of creating the tracks, and also engaging with the music. Ultimately, the user is able to
            engage
            with the content in a meaningful way.
        </h3>
        <h4>
            The challenge was to translate the interview text and the experience of listening to the 3D-spatial sound-based
            album
            into an engaging experience for the user to stay on the platform longer. The article needs to connect to the
            audience in
            a novel manner but also maintain the art direction and the general â€˜look and feelâ€™ of the publication. This
            simulated
            project is a part of MA in Interaction Design.

    <h3>
In Relations is an interactive experiment to explore how the individual places themselves in relation to others through
the generated pattern of touch. Using an empty canvas with a randomised "self" as a starting point, this project is a
meditative process for the individual to begin reflecting upon their various relationships from casual to intimate. The
initial "self" remains unchanged for the whole duration of the exercise but is randomly generated each time the page is
refreshed. This puts a concrete ground in a given moment in time, place, and circumstance.
    </h3>
    <h4>
        The project is created during the first Spanish pandemic lockdown in March 2020. Being in a new country alone, afar from
        familiar initimacies, made me reflect on the nature and development of my close relations (past partners, family
        members, friends, etc.). Who have I drifted or gotten closer to over the years, what traits I seek in others, and what
        traits I should improve on to be a better person for others.
