    <h3>
        Vacuna Ruc is an imaginary User Experience project that would help the Catalan government efficiently carry out the
        inoculation campaign against COVID-19. The native app would be the first of its kind to provide end-to-end vacccination
        process in Catalonia, from booking an appointment to generating a digital passport for multiple users. Vacuna Ruc is a
        compact and easy to use app, integrating core features of other existing apps in the Catalonia digital health ecosystem
        into a single accessible platform.
    </h3>
    <h4>
        The main goal of the app was to reduce the stress from the offline team and get at least 35% of the population onto our
        app. Released in three phases, it is ensured to be put to use as soon as possible. It is utilitarian, fast, and easy to
        use for the larger population. Most importantly, it is modular and is able to adapt rapidly to the new developments of
        the pandemic.

            <p>Ecosystem analysis gave us an overall insights into Catalonia‚Äôs digital health framework. We found a lot of functional
            redundency in each app. Additionally, each app has one specific function and the existance of numerous platforms
            confuses the user. Our app integrates functions from existing apps and allows the user to get information, take action,
            and track status all-in-one platform.</p>

                who will be the first to get vaccinated. I interviewed 17 people and we created five personas: 1) healthcare worker, 2)
                65+ group that are willing to be vaccinated, 3) 65+ group with low incentive for vaccination, 4) 65+ that are
                misinformed, 5) children of 65+ that will be helping their parents to sign up.</p>
                <p class="lowertext-p">Main takeaways are that there are lack of reliable information about vaccine, 65+ group with low digital literacy need
                help signing up, and that the current vaccination process is time consuming and complicated .</p>
