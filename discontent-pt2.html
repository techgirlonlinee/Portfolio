    <h3>
    Interactive featured article under Discontent, an electronic music publication. The long-format translates an interview
    of Lapalux‚Äôs album ‚ÄòAmnioverse‚Äô into an immersive digitalised experience. The user is guided through Lapalux‚Äôs
    inspirations, process of creating the tracks, and also engaging with the music. Ultimately, the user is able to engage
    with the content in a meaningful way.
    </h3>
    <h4>
    The challenge was to translate the interview text and the experience of listening to the 3D-spatial sound-based album
    into an engaging experience for the user to stay on the platform longer. The article needs to connect to the audience in
    a novel manner but also maintain the art direction and the general ‚Äòlook and feel‚Äô of the publication. This simulated
    project is a part of MA in Interaction Design.

            <div>
                <p>‚ÄòAmnioverse‚Äô album is an exploration of ‚Äúself-created universe‚Äù through an amniotic-sac. The article builds upon this
                    perspective of an amniotic-sac traveling through the universe and stumbling upon different interactive features
                    against
                    the backdrop of vast emptiness.</p>
                <p class="lowertext-p">The spatial sound indicated our smallness and vulnerability yet it is met with whispered vocals and articulated
                    melodies
                    to provide comfort and intimacy to indicate that we are not alone. The contrast between fear of loneliness and
                    collective realisation is used to guide the experience of the article. An immersive universe is provided for the
                    audience to experience the discomfort of loneliness.</p>
                <p class="lowertext-p">The user is able to engage with whispered voices, play with modular synth to replicate Lapalux‚Äôs sound, or even to
                    enter
                    different spaces. Consequently, the user is able to have an immersive experience of the album by the end of the
                    article
                    and find peace in the collective consciousness.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The 12-column grid was utilised ‚Äì same grid as Discontent publication ‚Äì to maintain consistency and give flexibility
                    for
                    the changing alignment of each interview questions. Each block of texts are designed to look like they are floating
                    in a
                    universe, thus are aligned to different columns of the grid. This provides variations within the controlled system
                    of
                    the grid that gives structure and balance to the varied content.</p>
                <p class="lowertext-p">In addition, the grid also helps structure the interview format. Each pair of question and answer follows the same
                    composition. There is a column gap between each speaker so the reader can easily distinguish different kinds of
                    content.</p>

                <p class="lowertext-p">User could engage with the syth by hold their click and turn the knob to learn Lapalux‚Äôs process. The syth could be
                overwhelming for those who has not seen one before and would be too irrelavent if they could just play with all the
                buttons. Thus, the user is guided to recreate one of Lapalux‚Äôs tracks by following the flashing red circle.</p>

            Maurice Andresen). This feature appears right after the interview question about spoken words in Lapalux‚Äôs tracks.
            Without leaving the page, the user is able to immerse themselves visually and aurally into Lapalux‚Äôs musical element.
            This further adds more meaning and understanding of the interview.</p>

                    The image is taken from a James Turrell‚Äôs installation who is Lapalux‚Äôs main inspiration behind the album. In his
                    answer
                    to the previous interview question, he offered an insight about the installation image he would look at for
                    everyday. He
                    said ‚Äúpeople are sitting in what looks like a waiting room lit in a purple hue, looking up at the dark night sky
                    through
                    a hole in the ceiling... it seems like we are all in that waiting room, waiting to be somewhere or go somewhere.‚Äù

                <p class="lowertext-p">The feature offers the same waiting room experience asking the reader to wait for a shooting star that appears on scroll
                interaction. The ‚Äúwaiting room‚Äù ends with the reader entering the installation into black hole and the user is taken
                back to the article again.</p>

                <p>One of Lapalux‚Äôs unique sound characteristic is his use of binaural spacial spanning integrating in every track. The
                technique allows the listener to hear sound in a 3D environment like you are in an actual place. This immersive feature
                is for the reader to actually interact with and experience Lapalux‚Äôs reply to an interview question directly before the
                room appeared. The user can click to change the X position and hear the same melodies but from different spatial sound
                within the room. The reader can scroll down further to exit the room back to the article.
